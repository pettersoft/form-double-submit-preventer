# form-double-submit-preventer
Prevents users from submitting forms twice accidently (elderly users tend to do this in my experience)

## Dependencies
- jQuery. Essentially any version.
- Bootstrap 3. Might work with 4, haven't tried. 
**Actually boostrap isn't required. Just add a .disabled CSS class**
